# Managing the Fullstack Application

1. Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?

  > | Data can be bound one way if we use v-bind or two ways with v-model. |

2. The `SPA` acronym stands for what?

  > | SPA stands for single Page Applications. |

3. What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?

  > | Single Page Applications provide the advantage of functionality without reloading the page each time a user performs an action. This makes it a faster user experience and reduces server load. They are also easier to develop and manage. |

4. What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?

  > | The onMounted method in Vue is a lifecycle hook which performs actions after the component has been mounted. |

5. What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

  > | The v-model attribute in Vue is for two way data binding. It syncs up the data in the input fields and the vue component. This is helpful when editing a form because the information already there will appear. |

6. What is the package.json file used for?

  > | The package.json file is used for the necessary dependencies and version control. It would be helpful to talk about this in more detail. |

7. Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?

  > | v-if, v-else-if, v-else, and v-show |

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?

  > | Instead of writing out a list of all options in an array, we can use v-for to do it for us. They key tells which array of data to use to render each to the page as desired. |

9. What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?

  > | The <slot> element is part of Vue. It is used to insert a component template that can be used many times in many places instead of writing out the same code each time. |
