# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> | Inheritance is when components share data and reuse functionality by extending or inheriting from other components. |

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a way to access that instance from any point in the application. |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> | The observer pattern is when the subject maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. |

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | The Strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. The pattern allows a client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime, independently of the clients that use it. |

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | The Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating the instance of the appropriate class. |

06. What is test driven development?

> | Test-Driven Development is an approach where developers write tests for a specific piece of functionality before implementing the code. The process involves a cycle of writing a failing test, implementing the minimum code to pass the test, and then refactoring. TDD aims to catch defects early, promote incremental development, and improve overall code quality. |

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> | In Scrum, the "Definition of Done" is a set of criteria or conditions that a product increment must meet for the team to consider it complete. |

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> | As a yoga routine user, I want to be able to use the same pose multiple times, as repeating a pattern of poses is good for the body. As a yoga routine user, I want to be able to hear and see when I need to change poses, so that I am notified in multiple ways if I miss one of the cues. |

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> | Sprint Backlog is created during the Sprint Planning ceremony. |

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> |  |
