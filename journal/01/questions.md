# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | We use Git to save work on the cloud in case of damage to the computer that is being used to create it. It saves both the most recent version and all previous versions saved if needing to reference them. It also allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | make new directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A psuedo-class applies a rule to an element when an action is placed on it. I think the most common ones I'd use would be hover, selection, and after.  |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity is kind of like the order of operations for the system to read. It provides a value to rules that could possibly govern the same element. The rule with the higher specificity value will be used. It can be used to my benefit to override a generic rule used to start once we have more detailed rules added later on.  |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | If !important is used in HTML it could be very hard to find out why the element isn't updating when you edit CSS. If you use it on multiple rules that effect the same element, it will use the last !important placed which could be hard to find in your code once it gets large. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | The three elements that make up a CSS rule are the selector first (h1), property next (color), and value after (rgba(255, 210, 33, .75)). |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Good design on a website helps people feel like the business is safe and legit. If it looks unappealing it feels like a fraudulent website. It also conveys a sense of professionalism. You're more likely to trust a company with a service that you need or your money if it looks as though they have enough income (business) to have an appealing website. Through design alone you can convey the style and priority of the company. If an artsy business had a boring black and white website it would be hard to trust they do art well. The product should match the design.|

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | There are many purposes to wireframing. Some are to keep the project user focused, to plan out the layout, to help in communication between the developer and the client, clarify functionality, to visualize how features work together, and to provide a sketch or mock up before doing all the detailed work to create it. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes, I think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort because it can help to provide honest feedback and find pain points before spending even more time on a project that may need serious adjustments that could be harder to fix at that point. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | The display flex property makes the children within to be flexible container more easily controlled to adjust different properties so you have a lot of variety in its positioning. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | The properties that affect the size of the box model are width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height. |
