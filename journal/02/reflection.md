# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Day 1 this week was rough! The lab gave me a headache so I couldn't work on it as long as I did the prior week's labs. Day 2 lecture made me seriously question if I can learn this! But thanks to Jeremy and Savannah talking me through each step in the lab of day 2, I finally understood what they were explaining. I still don't have a full grasp on JavaScript, but I at least felt like I saw improvement in my understanding by the end of day 2. Day 3 was better. Starting to feel like I get it. Day 4 back in the toilet. haha. Definitely didn't feel as good doing the partner project as I did last week. Tutoring helped but really counting on getting most of the checkpoint requirements done during lab tomorrow since I can't seem to come up with anything on my own and just go in circles. I'm really hoping next week goes better than this week. But at least last week's material is getting easier and faster!
